## Project Context

You are helping develop a **Sprinkler Business Management App** for an independent contractor. This is a 4-week aggressive development sprint to build a single-user MVP with mobile-first design.

### Key Project Information

- **Repository**: https://github.com/Stratose/sprinkler-business-app
- **Current Status**: Week 1 of 4-week development sprint
- **Development Server**: http://localhost:5173
- **Supabase Project**: https://lhrzcnovizsjdmlaphcy.supabase.co

## Required Reading

**CRITICAL**: Before making any architectural or feature decisions, you MUST review these documents:

1. **[Business Requirements Document](./business-requirements.md)** - Contains all business objectives, feature requirements, acceptance criteria, and success metrics
2. **[Technical Requirements Document](./technical-requirements.md)** - Contains technology stack, database schema, API specifications, and security requirements
3. **[Project Documentation README](./README.md)** - Overview of all project documentation

## Current Technology Stack

### Confirmed Architecture (DO NOT CHANGE)

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Pinia
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for iOS/Android + PWA
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0 via Supabase Auth
- **Maps**: Google Maps API
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E testing
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)

### Database Schema (IMPLEMENTED)

- **customers** - Customer information with GPS coordinates
- **customer_notes** - Notes and documentation per customer
- **appointments** - Scheduled appointments and service calls
- **media_files** - Images and videos with metadata
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Fully implemented for user data isolation

## Project Status

### ‚úÖ Completed

- Vue 3 + TypeScript + Capacitor project setup
- Supabase project created and configured
- Database schema implemented with RLS policies
- Environment variables configured (.env setup)
- Git repository initialized and connected to GitHub
- Comprehensive business and technical requirements documented
- Playwright E2E testing framework configured
- GitHub issue templates and project management structure created

### üîÑ In Progress

- Google OAuth authentication implementation
- Basic customer CRUD operations

### ‚è≥ Upcoming (4-Week Timeline)

- **Week 1**: Foundation (Auth + basic CRUD + UI framework)
- **Week 2**: Core features (Customer management + Maps integration)
- **Week 3**: Advanced features (Notes + Media + Calendar)
- **Week 4**: Polish + Deploy (Mobile optimization + Production)

## Development Environment

### Local Setup

- **Development Server**: `npm run dev` (runs on localhost:5173)
- **Testing**: `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright tests)
- **Build**: `npm run build` (production build)

### Key Files

- **Environment**: `.env` (Supabase + Google Maps API keys)
- **Database Schema**: `database-schema.sql` (applied to Supabase)
- **Main App**: `src/App.vue` + `src/views/HomeView.vue`
- **Supabase Client**: `src/lib/supabase.ts`

## Business Requirements Summary

### Core Features (REQ-001 to REQ-014)

1. **Customer Management**: Full CRUD with contact details and GPS coordinates
2. **Maps Integration**: Google Maps with customer pins and route optimization
3. **Appointment Scheduling**: Calendar-based with reminders and status tracking
4. **Notes & Media**: Rich text notes + photo/video storage (5MB images, 50MB videos)
5. **Authentication**: Google OAuth with secure session management
6. **Mobile Support**: iOS/Android apps + responsive web interface

### Critical Business Rules

- Single-user system initially (no multi-tenant features yet)
- Mobile-first design approach
- Offline capabilities as nice-to-have (not required for MVP)
- No real-time features or push notifications needed initially
- Manual data sync approach (not real-time)

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements

- Mobile app load time < 3 seconds on 4G
- Map rendering < 2 seconds
- Database queries < 500ms average
- Mobile memory usage < 100MB

### Security Requirements

- Google OAuth 2.0 authentication only
- Row Level Security (RLS) for all user data
- HTTPS only for all communications
- Secure environment variable management

## GitHub Project Management

### Issue Templates Available

- **Feature Request**: For new features and enhancements
- **Bug Report**: For reporting issues with reproduction steps
- **Task**: For development tasks and user stories
- **Documentation**: For documentation updates
- **DevOps**: For infrastructure and deployment tasks

### Project Structure

- **Labels**: Priority, type, component, and status labels configured
- **Milestones**: 4-week sprint milestones aligned with development phases
- **Project Board**: Kanban-style board with automated workflows
- **Setup Guide**: Complete instructions in `.github/project-setup.md`

## Important Guidelines

### Decision Making

1. **Always reference business requirements** before proposing features
2. **Stick to the approved technology stack** - no architectural changes without business justification
3. **Prioritize mobile-first** design and performance
4. **Follow the 4-week timeline** - aggressive but achievable scope
5. **Maintain security standards** - RLS policies and authentication required

### Development Approach

- **Feature branches** for all development work
- **Pull requests** with code review required
- **Playwright tests** for all major features
- **Mobile compatibility** verified for all features
- **Performance testing** with each major change

### Communication Style

- **Be specific** about technical implementations
- **Reference requirement IDs** (REQ-001, etc.) when discussing features
- **Provide code examples** with Vue 3 Composition API
- **Consider mobile implications** for all suggestions
- **Maintain aggressive timeline** awareness

## Current Priorities

### Week 1 Focus (Current)

1. **Google OAuth Implementation** - Critical for user authentication
2. **Vercel Deployment Setup** - Required for testing and collaboration
3. **Basic Customer CRUD** - Foundation for all customer features
4. **UI Framework** - Consistent design system

### Next Steps

- Complete Google OAuth integration with Supabase
- Set up automated deployment pipeline
- Build customer management interface
- Integrate Google Maps API

# Issue Title: Review and optimize production deployment configuration

## Issue Type

**Task - DevOps**

## Priority

**Medium** - Production stability

## Component

**Deployment & Configuration**

## Description

While the app has been successfully deployed to Vercel, there may be production-specific configuration issues that need attention, especially related to OAuth URLs and environment variables.

## Current Status

- ✅ App successfully deployed to Vercel
- ✅ Basic routing working via vercel.json
- ❓ OAuth redirect URLs may need production URL updates
- ❓ Environment variables may need production-specific values

## Potential Issues to Investigate

1. **OAuth Configuration**

   - Google OAuth redirect URLs in Supabase console
   - Site URL configuration in Supabase project settings
   - OAuth callback URL matching production domain

2. **Environment Variables**

   - Verify all required environment variables are set in Vercel
   - Check if any variables need production-specific values
   - Ensure sensitive keys are properly encrypted

3. **Route Configuration**
   - Verify SPA routing works correctly with Vercel
   - Check if all routes are properly protected
   - Ensure 404 handling works as expected

## Technical Details

**Files Involved:**

- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- Environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Supabase project settings
- Google OAuth console configuration

**OAuth URLs to Verify:**

- Production site URL: `https://[deployment-name].vercel.app`
- OAuth callback URL: `https://[deployment-name].vercel.app/auth/callback`
- Supabase redirect URLs configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OAuth flow works completely in production
- [ ] All environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Route protection works correctly in production
- [ ] No console errors in production build
- [ ] All authentication flows tested in production environment

## Investigation Steps

1. **Test OAuth flow in production**

   - Verify Google OAuth works with production URLs
   - Check if callback URL is properly configured
   - Test authentication state persistence

2. **Review environment variables**

   - Compare development vs production environment variables
   - Ensure all required keys are present
   - Verify Supabase URLs and keys are correct

3. **Test route protection**
   - Verify unauthenticated users can't access protected routes
   - Test direct URL navigation to protected routes
   - Check if login redirects work correctly

## Effort Estimate

**Small (1-2 hours)**

- Investigation and testing: 1 hour
- Configuration updates: 30 minutes
- Final testing: 30 minutes

## Labels

- `devops`
- `priority:medium`
- `component:deployment`
- `component:auth`
- `status:ready`

## Dependencies

- Access to Vercel dashboard
- Access to Supabase project settings
- Access to Google OAuth console

## Success Metrics

- All authentication flows work in production
- No deployment-related errors
- Proper OAuth configuration confirmed

## Notes

This is a verification and cleanup task to ensure the production deployment is properly configured. Should be completed soon after initial deployment to catch any configuration issues early.
